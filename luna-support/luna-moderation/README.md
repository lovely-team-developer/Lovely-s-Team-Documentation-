# Moderation Command

## Permission Needed

To use any moderation commands, you must have a role with `ban` and `kick` permission in the server you are using the command in. If you are not a moderator, you'll get one of these errors: 

* You must have `BAN` permission in order to use this command!
* You must have `KICK` permission in order to use this command!
