# Set Up
## How to set up your profile
To set up your profile, first look at all the profile commands using `!help`. In the command list, look for the section called "Profile Commands:" and choose a command to use. For example: `!setname` or `!setage`. You can do many things with your profile! You can look at the image below for an example of a user profile and what you can do with it. To see your profile after setting it up, simply use the following command: `!profile` or to view another user profile, use `!profile <Mention/User ID>`.

In `!setprofileimage` you **must** contain an image link! Also in `!setprofilecolor` you **must not** contain "#" in your color hex!
